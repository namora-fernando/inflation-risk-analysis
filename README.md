# Inflation Risk Analysis (WIP)

🚧 Work In Progress 🚧  
This flagship portfolio project focuses on analyzing inflation risk across multiple countries.  
The goal is to build a data pipeline, perform exploratory analysis, create risk scoring features, and finally deliver insights through a Power BI dashboard.

## Tools & Stack 🛠️
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Power BI**: interactive dashboard *(WIP)*
